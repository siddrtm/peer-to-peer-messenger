purely distributed peer to peer social network


peer to peer social networks that are already present are not purely decenralized they
contain a central authority which stores data about user (i.e list of users present in
the network), these type of networks can be brought down by government or any private 
authority on legal(inappropriate) grounds and hence keeping the government on the mercy 
of government and are not truely free.So we aim to design a network that is truely 
distributed.

In our model rather than storing the data(information about who exists on network) on 
a centralized server we would store it in distributed manner on user(member of network) 
nodes.

The overview of concept can be explained as -

	
our app would consist of four major parts
1)	user profile
		it would contain the users personal information like name, address, phone no, hobbies etc
		
		this data would be present on the users system and on some of peers on network in encrypted 
		fashion without their knowledge
				this is to make sure that if someone is trying to access the data of the user that is 
				currently not on network  he can access it from one of the copy on network with high 
				probability.
				this data can only be accessed by peers who have right to do so.
		
2)	user id
		as soon as new profile is created app allots a new unique id to user which represents the user
		there would be one id per user
		multiple instances of app can have same id
				this is to make sure user can access his account from different systems.
				
3)	list of peers
		every user system will contain a list of n(a constant) peers(members of network)
			this is to take in account pure decentralization in a distributed manner
					this would somewhat resemble mechanism of website crawling(i.e. how links 
					are searched on world wide web) 
					
4) 	encrypted data of peers
		the user system will contain the profile information of some peers in encrypted fashion
		without their knowledge.


Implementation would require networking(Tcp/Ip), encryption, database management concepts.
